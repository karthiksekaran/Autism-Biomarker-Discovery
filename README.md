# Autism-Biomarker-Discovery

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a serious form of neurodevelopmental disorder that mainly affects the children at to the age group of 2 to 5. It can be controlled, but not be cured permanently if diagnosed later. Treatments such as antipsychotic medications and behavioral therapy are more effective. Factors such as genetic and environmental conditions plays a vital role in development of ASD. So, identification of the prognostic biomarkers that are responsible for ASD development is a key part in gene expression analysis. In this work, gene expression profiles of ASD and normal group of samples are compared and analyzed to identify transcriptomic signatures of ASD that can be ideally used for the identification of ASD from gene expressions. The datasets are accessed from Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). The results obtained in this work outperformed the previous state of art methods in terms of predictabilty.
